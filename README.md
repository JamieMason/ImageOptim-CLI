## üì£ Summary

While other image optimization tools are available from the command line, ImageOptim-CLI exists because the [current benchmarks](http://jamiemason.github.io/ImageOptim-CLI/) suggest that ImageOptim, ImageAlpha and JPEGmini currently outperform those alternatives over lossless and lossy optimizations.

ImageOptim-CLI is written in TypeScript and AppleScript but is distributed as a self-contained executable binary, you don't need Node.js installed to use ImageOptim-CLI.

Check out this short [video demo of ImageOptim-CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGBounRIzSs) to see how it works.

## üå© Installation

### [npm](https://npmjs.org/)

    npm install -g imageoptim-cli

### [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

    brew update
    brew install imageoptim-cli

### Manual

Otherwise, you can install manually by downloading the latest release then adding ImageOptim-CLI to your [\\\\$PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).

    # go to home directory
    cd ~
    # download the tarball (change 3.0.7 to latest version if available)
    curl --output imageoptim-cli.tgz https://registry.npmjs.org/imageoptim-cli/-/imageoptim-cli-3.0.7.tgz
    # extract the tarball
    tar -xvzf ./imageoptim-cli.tgz
    # delete the tarball
    rm imageoptim-cli.tgz
    # rename the directory extracted from the tarball
    mv ./package ./imageoptim-cli
    # make imageoptim command available in your terminal
    export PATH=$PATH:imageoptim-cli/dist

> Saving somewhere in your home directory such as `~/imageoptim-cli` is recommended, but not essential. Saving to `/Applications` is **not** recommended, do not do this.

## üïπ Usage

        --number-of-colors <n>  ImageAlpha palette size, defaults to 256
        --quality <min>-<max>   ImageAlpha quality range from 0-100, defaults to 65-80
        --speed <n>             ImageAlpha speed from 1 (brute-force) to 10 (fastest), defaults to 1
        -h, --help              output usage information

      Supported Apps:

        ImageAlpha: https://pngmini.com
        ImageOptim: https://imageoptim.com
        JPEGmini Lite: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jpegmini-lite/id525742250
        JPEGmini Pro: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jpegmini-pro/id887163276
        JPEGmini: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jpegmini/id498944723

      Examples:

        Run ImageOptim.app over every image in current directory
        imageoptim

        Run ImageAlpha.app and ImageOptim.app over every PNG in current directory
        imageoptim --imagealpha '**/*.png'

        Run JPEGmini.app and ImageOptim.app over every JPG in current directory
        imageoptim --jpegmini '**/*.jpg' '**/*.jpeg'

        Run ImageOptim.app over every image in a specific directory
        imageoptim '~/Desktop'

## ‚ö†Ô∏è JPEGmini and support for assistive devices

You may be presented with the following message the first time you run ImageOptim-CLI with the `--jpegmini` flag.

> To automate JPEGmini we need to add Terminal.app (or iTerm.app etc) to the 'support for assistive devices' whitelist.

The JPEGmini OS X Apps don't include a command line API, so a real user is simulated by entering synthetic clicks and keyboard commands instead. This requires your permission and is easily set up in System Preferences as shown by these guides.

## ‚ùì FAQs

### General

#### Do ImageOptim, ImageAlpha, or JPEGmini come bundled with the ImageOptim-CLI installation?

You will need to install these applications separately.

#### Do I have to pay to use ImageOptim-CLI?

The CLI, ImageOptim and ImageAlpha are all free. JPEGmini is a paid-for product but you can use ImageOptim-CLI and choose not to run JPEGmini.

#### The WebP image format looks promising, can you get ImageOptim-CLI to convert images to it?

WebP looks great and may well overtake the formats handled by ImageOptim-CLI, but converting images to WebP is outside ImageOptim-CLI's chosen remit.

#### Can you get ImageOptim-CLI to skip images it has already processed, if they haven't changed?

JPEGmini does this today, but for ImageOptim and ImageAlpha I feel a feature like this belongs in those applications rather than this automator.

### ImageOptim

#### ImageOptim makes the fans on my Mac run at full power.

Optimising images is a pretty intensive process, so instead of optimising one image at a time (which would take forever) ‚Äî ImageOptim optimises many images at the same time until all of them are done.

A side effect of this is that the fans come on at full power to keep your machine cool while it's maxed out.

### ImageAlpha

#### I don't think ImageAlpha is running, I can't see anything.

ImageOptim-CLI uses ImageAlpha's internal installation of [pngquant](http://pngquant.org) so it's normal that nothing is shown on screen.

It's also possible that if you look in the [Activity Monitor](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5890) you will not see `pngquant` displayed but it _is_ being run. In my experience it's only when you run ImageOptim-CLI on a very large number of PNGs that you have enough time to spot it. ensure that Activity Monitor's **Update Frequency** is set to **Very Often (1 sec)**.

### JPEGmini

#### Can I use ImageOptim-CLI with JPEGmini Lite, the free version of JPEGmini?

Yes.

#### I upgraded from JPEGmini Lite to JPEGmini but ImageOptim-CLI still says JPEGmini is not installed.

Performing the in-app upgrade leaves the app named as jpegmini-lite, so ImageOptim-CLI can't determine whether it's the free or full version. It is better to instead buy [the full version of JPEGmini](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jpegmini/id498944723) separately.

#### ImageOptim-CLI says ‚ÄúTo automate JPEGmini we need to enable GUI Scripting‚Äù, how do I do that?

See this tutorial on [how to manage Accessibility preferences and GUI Scripting](http://www.macosautomation.com/mavericks/guiscripting/index.html). In the case of OS X Mavericks, you will want to add the Applications JPEGmini and Terminal (or equivalent such as iTerm).

### Windows and Linux

#### Can I use ImageOptim-CLI on Windows or Linux?

ImageOptim-CLI is responsible for automating 3 OS X applications so is inherently bound to OS X for that reason.

#### Are there any plans for ImageOptim-CLI to support Windows or Linux?

It would first require ImageOptim, ImageAlpha, and JPEGmini to be available for those platforms.

#### I don't have OS X, can you recommend an alternative to ImageOptim-CLI?

[@addyosmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) wrote a really thorough article on [tools for image optimization](http://addyosmani.com/blog/image-optimization-tools/) which discusses a wide range of options in great detail.
